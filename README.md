Kata Fizz buzz with Object calisthenics

Object Calisthenics outlines 9 basic rules to apply when performing the exercise:

• One level of indentation per method.

• Don't use the ELSE keyword.

• Wrap all primitives and Strings in classes.

• First class collections.

• One dot per line.

• Don't abbreviate.

• Keep all classes less than 50 lines.

• No classes with more than two instance variables.

• No getters or setters.


ALLOW ME:
- use getter but with only own classes
- use boolean with the equals method
